# FizzBuzz

Implement a FizzBuzz. Check if your code works, by using UnitTests.

FizzBuzz is a simple program, that accepts a number as input.
It returns:

* Fizz for all inputs, that are divisible by 3
* Buzz for all inputs, that are divisible by 5
* FizzBuzz for all inputs, that are divisible by 3 and 5
* An error for negative numbers.
* An empty string for all other inputs
